# Log_Analysis_Script

## Description
This submission is a Python script designed to analyze server log files and count the number of requests made by each IP address. It reads log data from a file, processes each line to extract IP addresses, and aggregates the request counts. The output provides a clear breakdown of the IP addresses and their corresponding request frequencies, helping identify usage patterns or potential anomalies. This tool is particularly useful for server administrators and developers monitoring web traffic or debugging server issues.
